# GF-Graphics-Final #

#Usage #
To run the program, just compile and run it. No extra installations are required. Once you start the program, a 
spaceship will render towards the bottom center of the screen. Using the left, right, up and down arrow keys, you must dodge the 
onslaught of space rocks flying down from the top of the screen. The longer you survive, the more rocks will fall at the
 same time. If your spaceship contacts a rock, the screen will turn red and the game is over. You must use the Escape 
 key to quit the game.  
#Program details (for graders) #
The polymorphism all occurs in the fallingstuff parent class, and the assorted sized rock subclasses.
